/** \brief Constructs a list of neighboring conjugated segments.

Callname: neighborlist

Two segments are added to this list if the distance between centers of mass of any their rigid fragments is below a certain cutoï¬€. This allows neighbors to be selected on a criterion of minimum distance of approach rather than center of mass distance, which is useful for molecules with anisotropic shapes.
